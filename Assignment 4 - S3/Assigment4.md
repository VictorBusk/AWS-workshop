1. Modify the Lambda function from the previous assignment to read the contents of the file from the S3 bucket using the AWS SDK for .NET.
2. Install the AWS SDK for .NET NuGet package in your Lambda project.
3. In the Lambda function code, use the AmazonS3Client class to create a new instance of the S3 client and read the contents of the file from the S3 bucket using the GetObjectAsync method.
4. Test the Lambda function to make sure it can read the contents of the file from the S3 bucket.
5. Update the API Gateway endpoint to invoke the Lambda function and return the contents of the file.
